# Prediction-of-Hotel-Booking-Cancellation
It’s a Machine Learning based prediction model used to predict weather the hotel booking going to be cancelled or not by reading a large dataset and analyzing it. The Objective of this project was to have hands-on experience with ML Algorithms on real world data set. ML Algorithm used Decision Tree Classifier, Gaussian NB, Random Forest Classifier, K Neighbors Classifier, Logistic Regression and out off all these algorithms Random Forest Classifier works the best with 95.27% Accuracy. Software used: IDE – JUPYTER NOOTBOOK
